# Kinect-Gesture-Detection
Gesture tracking using Kinect and OpenCV, part of a future Cockpit concept for GE

This code uses a Kinect2 Sensor ot sense a hand and identify Gestures. A sample output is also included, as an example of the kinds of things that can be achieved with Gesture recognition.

Due to the use of only a single camera, only gestures that can be identified from above can be used.To Extend this work, a second camera could identify gestures from the side.

Hand and gesture detection is done by means of several classical image processing techniques. no machine learning is used.

Libraries used include OpenCV and Pygame

NOTE: Videos of this code in opertion with appropriate setup are listed in this github
